Really late. Each one started out with 1 synth and a drum machine, recorded straight to cassette. Then I went back and carved out the final track with other machines and edits. It's tough to remember all the machines... It's a nice mix of mostly analog boxes and a few digital ones. Really nice to finally release these tracks. ",

            "text": "Recorded during most of 2013, tracks 1-6 were inspired by older Sc-fi films and discussions with my Ukrainian friend, Irina. Themes were decided upon, her vocals were recorded and I continued to refine the best tracks from my recording sessions. All tracks made with a modest hardware-only setup: TR-808, Matrix 1000, SH-101, SH-2, Monomachine, Slim Phatty and Blofeld. However to give the best flexibility, a handful of software sequencers were used to control a couple synthesizers. These 6 tracks were mastered by the talented Shawn Hatfield at AudibleOddities in Oakland, California... using analog equipment only. Track 7 is a collection of experiments using hardware & software synthesizers from the past 3 or 4 years. From time to time, I'll spend an evening with a chosen piece of kit and let my mind meld with the instrument... pushing boundaries, exploring textures and recording the process. *Please note: There are ultra-low frequencies within. Watch your speakers & volume. Track 8 is a collection of tracks recorded in 2014 on three different airplanes over the course of 24 hours. Each piece was recorded live on a tablet computer, using a combination of various apps, in real-time using no overdubs. From Louisville to Chicago to Los Angeles to Auckland, I travelled into the future... missing a day completely in the process. These are the sounds during that time. This is Volna. It's a journey into space, to other worlds, crossing parallel dimensions, through wormholes... floating freely into the unknown. (Vocals by: Irina Goloborodko) ",

Borrowing from techniques of musique concrète and granular synthesis, I also incorporated manipulated samples as melodies and rhythm. The end result sounds quite different compared to my recent “acid” tracks, and somewhat hints back to my earlier output from years ago. The journey, at times difficult, was refreshing and allowed pure creative freedom. I feel that the tracks which were selected for the final release honestly showcase my experience.

The title track provides dance floor slamming with a TR-909 & SH-7 pounding the heart, and the MC-202 & TB-303 layering the acid woolliness in & out of existence. Junebug showcases a more stripped-down track with the TR-606 & SH-101 doing what they do best: acid.  This EP ends with Rain Storm 14 taken from an archive of sound experiments using analog synth gear with acoustic guitar.  Here the MC-202 is layered with a rain storm recorded from inside his apartment’s fireplace. ",

A heavy TB-303 acid bassline is center to chirping cacophony.  Track 2, STS-135: Atlantis, uses the NASA provide audio track of the shuttle’s rocket boosters falling back to Earth once pushed away from the Orbiter.  Mixed with a TB-303 & MC-202, Rusuden gives the listener a dizzy, distorted experience to paint an image of what it’s like to have these massive structures fall back into our atmosphere.",

With a lot of trial and error, he was able to get them connected and in sync with his computer to record handfuls of tracks using his “studio performance” style. His favorite tracks are represented here as Death By Din Sync, referencing the pre-MIDI technology to keep machines in time with one another. Primarily using vintage Roland and Korg machines, this release came about during the early stages of the analog revival from independent manufactures (ex: Dave Smith Instruments) and open source groups (ex: x0xb0x).  Their use and influence was also key to the overall tone and vibe.  (Photography by Nicholas Viltrakis)",

The snappily titled Fe IX/X 171 A, a scientific term relating to the process of imaging solar activity via ultraviolet light, features seven slices of unadulterated old school electro with subtle injections of acid and ambient, tempered with an ounce of Germanic minimalism. The mood evokes in turn the Richard D James of Polygon Window, early Ritchie Hawtin, B12 or early Black Dog even. Fe IX/X 171 A also marks a new creative peak for Rusuden. Clocking at just twenty-five minutes for seven tracks, Fe IX/X 171 A is a very concise and tight affair. Morgan’s delivery is confident and efficient. His soundscapes fuse classic electronic tones and futuristic vision, particularly on Snogon, Zanika or Takkong, whilst he engineers much coarser formations on tracks such as Yametarans or Yadokirin. The compositions work on a variety of levels, as different elements become obvious with repeat listens. Cold bleeps, acid squirts and regimented beats reveal hidden lush warm analogue soundwaves, secondary melodies and even occasional voices to complete Rusuden’s intricate tapestry. Morgan keeps rhythms and melodies fluid and fresh, and excellent sonic consistency, all the way through as he focuses on setting feet as much as mind in motion. - The Milk Factory",

(No case, digital only) Track 10 is a remix of Global Goon. He had a contest on his site or a forum, I can't remember. That's him playing the bass... I played all the guitar parts. I still love this remix. Track 11 is a remix of Multiplex. They had a similar deal... Track 12 is a remix of Whitetrash Shaolin.

With some tracks themed on visits to an alien, other world lounge - you can almost see the smoke trails come off the imported cigarettes from planet Earth. Elsewhere, a mixture of ambient guitar noodling drifts into a braindance drum kit jumble, where vocal snips fade into a multi-colored blend of sound.",

Here, the mix of analog synthesizers and acoustic guitar are surrounded by a sea of noise and environmental change.  Is that train?  Is it rain?  Is that summer insects in Kentucky?  Cosm & Metacosm are tracks written with the amazing PerFourMer (mkI) by Vermona.  It’s a great sounding 4 part analog synth that gives some instant “Melodies From Mars” vibes.   The EP ends with End Credits which is driven by the Roland SH-5 in an out of tune rave world.",
